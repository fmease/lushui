# [Description]
# A component cannot directly access its transitive dependencies via `extern` paths.
# The transitive dependency needs to be either re-exported by a direct dependency
# (in which case it would be accessible as `extern.<direct>.<transitive>`) or made
# into a direct dependency in the package manifest. Deduplication of packages and
# therefore components is guaranteed.
