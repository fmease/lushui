;;; TEST fail check

use instantly-circular
use instantly-circular.dependency

;;; [Description]
;;; The first use-declaration is equivalent to `use instantly-circular as instantly-circular`
;;; defining the binding `instantly-circular` in the current module to be itself.
;;; The second declaration is also erroneous (`instantly-circular` does not have a proper value) but it
;;; clearly depends on the first error. Hence, it is but a mere consequential error and will not be reported
;;; separately.
