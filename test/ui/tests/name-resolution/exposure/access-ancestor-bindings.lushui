;;; [Description]
;;; Privacy is only one-way: Descendant modules or namespaces
;;; are in all cases permitted to refer to and use-bindings defined in
;;; parent/ancestor modules (unless such a binding breaks exposure rules to begin with)
;;; no matter their declared exposure reach (which is directed upwards).
;;; This should work for both use-declarations and inside expressions.
;;; Out of order declarations should not hinder the algorithm.
