module binder

;;; [Description]
;;; In contrast to the root module, the file name does not need to be a valid word.
;;; This is possible since an out-of-line module declaration always binds the module
;;; to a word binder. That's not a choice we have for the root module.
;;;
;;; Additionally, not permitting nonword filenames / locations would be pretty restrictive.
