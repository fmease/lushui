# we are using `@doc-attributes` right now since it's allowed on both modules and module headers, it's
# not "coexistable" (old terminology) and it's implemented.
# @Task use `@recursion-limit` (or anything non-internal) instead once it's implemented.
# @Task un-ignore once we have proper attributes or test attributes we can use here in place of
# @doc-attributes which has been removed
