# [Description]
# ‘For -> ...’ is equivalent to ‘...’ and ‘for => ...’ is equivalent to ‘...’.
# This is a natural consequence of the way we parse and lower parameters.
# It's not useful at the time of writing (it's probably nice for code generators).
# It might be considered harmful -- we could introduce a warn-by-default lint for these.
