@intrinsic
data Type: Type -> Type # @Bug disallow this

# [Description]
# Check that it is impossible for any no-core user to set the type of
# Type to anything other than Type.
#
# Despite Type being defined via a data declaration that declares the
# type of the intrinsic, the type of Type is still hardcoded inside of
# the compiler to be Type to simplify the implementation and to prevent
# the chance of introducing unsoundness.
