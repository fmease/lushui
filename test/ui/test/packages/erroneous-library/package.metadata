# [Description]
# This test checks if any errors inside of a component i.e. language-related errors like type errors,
# not package-related ones, actually have a negative effect on the outcome of the package check.
# It's incredibly fundamental but I want it to be part of the test suite anyway,
# even if other more specific tests include this check (implicitly).
