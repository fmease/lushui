;;; TEST compiler-args -Z internals

;;; @Note it used to be the case that we could report unrecognized intrinsic types *and* functions together in one module
;;; but we moved the registration of intrinsic types from the typer to the resolver

;;; @Bug for `@intrinsic i-definitely-do-not-exist: I-Definitely-Do-Not-Exist` only one error is reported
;;; being the "the binding is not defined" but the "unrecognized intrinsic" error is not reported
;;; @Task fix it and update this test again
