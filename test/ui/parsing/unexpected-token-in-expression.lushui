# Historically speaking for the longest time, we used to produce quite bad error messages for
# errors "within" (= while parsing) expressions. Today, after having ripped out backtracking and
# after having introduced a list of token expectations & error contexts to the parser,
# finally our diagnostics are quite okay.
#
# This test ensures that we stay at at least this level of quality.
