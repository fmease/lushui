# FIXME: (1) Currently, this would lead to a cycle error if this placed below
#            all the other declarations.
#        (2) This is non-determinstic and flaky (across Rust versions) and likely
#            change 180Â° on the next bump.
#        (3) We need to replace our rather naive cycle detection code with proper
#            SCC computation to fix actually this.
