= Derivation

Note that the library of this Cargo package named `derivation` is not actually marked with `proc-macro`.
Instead, it re-exports the procedural macros from an internal Cargo package called `derivation-macros`
whose library is the _actual_ proc-macro crate. This split will allow our future self to not only expose procedural
macros but any other type of item, in particular our own traits which we could then derive in `derivation-macros`.
Crates marked with `proc-macro` cannot currently expose non-proc-macros, a limitation imposed by `rustc`.
